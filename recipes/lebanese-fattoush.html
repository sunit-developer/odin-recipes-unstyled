<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Lebanese Fattoush is a vibrant and refreshing salad that hails from the Levantine cuisine, specifically Lebanon. It is a staple in many Middle Eastern households, known for its fresh ingredients and tangy flavors. The base of the salad consists of a variety of crisp vegetables, including tomatoes, cucumbers, radishes, and bell peppers, all chopped into bite-sized pieces. What sets Fattoush apart from other salads is the addition of fried or toasted pieces of pita bread, which add a delightful crunch and texture. Fresh herbs such as parsley and mint are generously added, enhancing the salad's aroma and taste. The dressing is a zesty blend of olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, and sumac, a tangy spice that gives Fattoush its distinctive flavor.

It is often enjoyed during gatherings and family meals, embodying the spirit of communal dining and sharing. The salad is not only delicious but also healthy, packed with vitamins and antioxidants from the fresh vegetables and herbs. The use of sumac in the dressing provides a unique tartness that balances the flavors beautifully, making each bite a burst of freshness. Whether you're looking to explore Middle Eastern cuisine or simply want to enjoy a wholesome salad, Lebanese Fattoush is a delightful and satisfying choice.
